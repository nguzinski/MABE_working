##Working version of my Multiple Authority Attribute Based Encryption server and client library
#Designed off of code provided form New Mexico State University and in conjunction with George Torres from NMSU
Primarily this was designed as a proof of concept for testing some ideas around doing attribute based encryption with secure hardware,
the project fell to the backburner after completion but I thought it would be a decent show of some (messy) research code that I am now allowed to distribute.
most requirements can be found within the main import.
